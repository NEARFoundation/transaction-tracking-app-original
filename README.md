near-accounting-report
==================

This [React] app was initialized with [create-near-app]


Quick Start
===========

To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you've installed [Node.js] â‰¥ 12 and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
1. You might also need to get your computer's public IP address allow-listed by Denys (or someone who has access to do so). TODO: Document this step better.
1. `cp .env .env.local`
1. `cp server/.env.development server/.env.development.local` and then edit the values.
1. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
1. `cd server && yarn install && docker-compose up -d --env-file .env.development.local && cd .. && yarn start:server`
1. In a second terminal: `yarn dev` (see `package.json` for a full list of `scripts` you can run with `yarn`)

Go ahead and play with the app and the code. As you make code changes, the app will automatically reload.

Docker Deploys
==================

TODO: Explain this section better.

Frontend
------------------
Preload

    cd docker
    ./prepare.sh

Build Docker image

    ./build.sh

docker/Dockerfile - contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

Run a new container

    ./run_server.sh

Backend
------------------
Preload

    cd server/docker
    ./prepare.sh

Build Docker image

    ./build.sh

Run a new container

    docker-compose --file docker-compose.yml --project-name api-near-accounting-report up -d


Exploring The Code
==================

1. The "backend" code lives in the `/server` folder. See the README there for
   more info.
2. The frontend code lives in the `/src` folder. `/src/index.html` is a great
   place to start exploring. Note that it loads in `/src/index.js`, where you
   can learn how the frontend connects to the NEAR blockchain.
3. Tests: there are different kinds of tests for the frontend and the backend
   See `server/README` for info about how it's tested. The frontend code gets
   tested with [jest]. You can run both of these at once with `yarn run test`.



Troubleshooting
===============

## port conflict 

If you get an error message about a port conflict, try running `docker container ls` and see which containers are active.

Then consider stopping each container via `docker stop {container ID}`, such as `docker stop b72358af5397`. Then try the Quick Start steps above again.


## EPERM

On Windows, if you're seeing an error containing `EPERM` it may be related to spaces in your path. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/zkat/npx/issues/209) for more details.
